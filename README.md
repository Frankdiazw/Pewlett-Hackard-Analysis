# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Pewlett Hackard is a large company with a large number of employees. As the baby boomers start to retire on a rapid rate, the company is looking into the future in two ways: The first one, is to offer a retirement pakage for those who meet certain criteria. The second one is to think about the positions that will need to be filled. 
For this module, the challenge was to create a DataBase for all the employees elegible for retirement.
For the challenge, the manager has given two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Using the previous data created in the module, the challenge was made in pgAdmin 4 and the code was store in Visual Studio Code in a .sql file type.
